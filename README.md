### Was it easy to complete the task using AI?
It was mainly useful for automating repetitive tasks, for example generating the controllers or helping me refresh some topics or generate some mySQL syntax.

### How long did the task take you to complete? 
Around an hour.

### Was the code ready to run after generation? What did you have to change to make it usable?
The code ChatGPT provided was rarely able to be run right away, only if it was a small snippet of code. I mainly had to change variable names, but other than that it was fine.

### Which challenges did you face during completion of the task?
I struggled mostly during the generation of the unit tests since that is where I have less knowledge, so I did not really have the necessary judgement to evaluate whether what ChatGPT was yielding was correct or not.

### Which specific prompts you learned as a good practice to complete the task?
I learned that I can ask it to provide me with folder structures for my projects, for example using this prompt:
`Can you provide a general folder architecture for building a RESTful API using spring?`
